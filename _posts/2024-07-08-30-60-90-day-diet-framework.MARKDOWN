Summary: Took the weekend off in part for the Fourth of July but always for my husband's birthday. Throguh this downtime I put my home gym back together, spent quality time with my fella, and had some focused conversations with my goals. THis post is about the 30-60-90 day plan I put together toward rebooting my lifestyle post Pandemic in an era of pervasive industrial anxiety. We can choose to live to work, or work to live. It's time I chose the latter.

Given my recent wake up call, by the numbers, I'm turning back to my old habits of diet and exercise again. THose pesky things I put in a box during The Pandemic and somehow forgot were important, if not enjoyable actually. My goal is to reduce bodyweight, by 14 lbs, and thus my metabolic age. Mine are not horrible, just not great, and I want to be around for my spouse and my family as long as I can so that's the motivation. Think less swim trunks and more cardiac and general fitness.

# Guidelines
1. Diet:
   - Nutrition: A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats.
   - Caloric Intake: Since my BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) is 1710 kcal, I am going for a slight caloric deficit to lose weight gradually. Aiming for about 1500-1600 kcal per day.
   - Limit Processed Foods: Reduce intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat, high-sugar snacks. These are not really a problem for me however, going on an absitience kick from evening wine with dinner will be a shift.
   - Hydration: Water water everywhere.

2. Exercise:
   - Cardio: Engage in aerobic exercises like walking, jogging, cycling, hiking, and swimming. Aiming for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity cardio per week.
   - Strength Training: Incorporate strength training exercises to build muscle mass. Aim for at least two to three days a week.
   - Flexibility and Balance: Include activities like yoga or stretching to improve flexibility and balance.

3. Lifestyle:
   - Sleep: Ensure you get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.
   - Stress Management: Practice stress-reducing techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or mindfulness.
   - Limit Alcohol: Fortunately, I'm not a smoker but I will be limiting alcohol consumption... so farewell summer beers.
   - Meditation: Daily sessions, end of story.

4. Check-Ups:
   - Monitor Health Metrics: Regularly check your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other important health markers which I dislike doing but it's time to start to track toward the goal.
   - Dr Visits: These have already been in a regular cadence but I am probably going to follow the 30-60-90 cadence for bloodwork to see how progress is moving and then do some longer range planning.

5. Baseline Routine:
   - Atomic Habits: With a focus on making small, consistent changes that can be maintained over the long term.
   - Logging Progress: Keep track of diet, exercise, and other health-related activities to monitor your progress and make necessary adjustments using a couple mobile apps (My Fitness Pal, Garmin Connect, Calm) that I have now toward this end and maybe some fun R scripting of the data.
