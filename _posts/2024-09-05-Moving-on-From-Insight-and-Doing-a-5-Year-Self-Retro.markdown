 Summary: Tomorrow is my last day at Insight, this is my self retro for my nearly six years as an Azure engineer, a team lead, a technical pre-sales solution architecht and a Power Platform Developer/Application architecht.

### Continuous Improvement

This is a phrase that we embrace in tech and would be wise to hold onto no matter what various shifts in the weather patterns suggest. My career has been carefully mapped by lessons—both the wins and the losses. 

> Continuous Improvement in Agile is about fostering a culture of learning and adaptation, where teams strive to be better over time by consistently evaluating their work and making incremental improvements.

From Glazer’s, solidifying my understanding of coding, SaaS solutions, and cloud. To Cardinal Solutions, with the fear of constant change being my prior barrier to tech services consulting. To Nationwide Insurance as a system architect because, for once, I chose my boss for her brilliant way with people and incredible ability to map out an entire organization's technology roadmap over a five- to ten-year period (the secret that she taught me was simple: listen, negotiate, illustrate). Then, most recently, Insight, to get my hands dirty, lift the weights every day in the gym of Visual Studio, and lean in to accomplish a dual goal of helping sell and win the work while keeping people off the bench toward helping our clients do what was needed. Ultimately, T-shaping even further by going back to my deep roots with Power Platform/M365 and pro-code solution stacks that empower the people we all serve—our product owners and their customers.

### Parting Words to my People
- Reach out to a colleague 1:1 style and check in to see what is recently exciting or challenging them, what they are struggling with, or what they've been doing for fun, just be there and listen.
- Write an (internal organization) recognize within Insight for someone and give line of sight to not just the big things, but the small ones, we all do for each other and our clients.
- Go to Linked In and write a recommendation for someone who has been laid off or any of your clients and or current/former colleagues to start building a public trail showing how that person has touched your career in some way.
- Volunteer your expertise to assist in any pre-sales activities to keep moving all of us toward our mutual goals and lining up the kinds of work that we love to do.
- Volunteer your coaching, speaking, writing, presentation and or code review time/skills to our peers and keep learning from and inspiring  one another.
- Challenge yourself when you start to feel "comfortable" (my cadence has been in roughly 3 to 5 years).
- Most importantly, be kind to yourselves, think the better kind of thoughts, speak gently when you address yourself in your heads, know that you are truly amazing in everyway.

### Next Chapter
I've been searching for a little over a year for the right scenario where I can bring all this to a head in servce of an organization and it's people in a way that does exactly what my "leaders's intent" is all about. Empowering People to accomplish many larger goals together with innovation and strategy in mind. I'll be announcing that when the time is right but for now, I'm humbled and grateful for my time at Insight. I actually cried after one of Nick's code reviews, then bucked up and learned from the knowledge of the experience. I made two life friends, through the Pandemic... they kept me going. And then all the opportunities alloted to help my team mates deal with day to day life as living breathing and growing professionals. What an honor it was to be a servant leader for them.

### My Retro
And finally, the five+ year retro that made me smile in how much, as difficult as some of these years were, made me stronger, more connected on a human level, and Insight, our people and our partners supported and included as we should all be in everything we do **together**.
