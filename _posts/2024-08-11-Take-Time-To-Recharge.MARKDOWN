**Summary:** So what happens when we take time to work on life balance?

> "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested." â€” Seneca

This post is about some important things to remember when you find your work & personal life scale in a bit of imbalance for longer than you can carry. It's also about the huge benefits of regular unplugging from, whatever it is, you do for a living to spend part of it living your life.

### Opening

My jam has been meditation, camping, and hiking. To be honest, it's probably what got me through the COVID years mentally intact as mine was one of the companies that went full-on remote. Lack of human contact and the culture I remember calling *culture* vs what it downgraded into after the fact, well, in there is a story of resiliency for all of us, but this story is about the benefits, and the why, of taking time for yourself. (Bonus points, look this phrase up in the dictionary "Shinrin-yoku" and you kind of get closer to where my head is at these days).

### 1. **Reduced Stress**
   - **Cortisol Levels:** Chronic work-related stress can lead to elevated levels of cortisol, a stress hormone. High cortisol levels are associated with a variety of health issues, including cardiovascular disease, immune dysfunction, and anxiety. Taking time off helps lower cortisol levels, reducing stress and its harmful effects.
   - **Mental Health:** Regular breaks from work can prevent burnout, a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. This helps maintain overall mental health and well-being.
   - **Heart Rate and Blood Pressure:** Has been shown to lower heart rate and blood pressure, contributing to a more relaxed state.
  
### 2. **Improved Cognitive Function**
   - **Brain Recovery:** Continuous work without sufficient breaks can lead to cognitive fatigue, impairing decision-making, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. Relaxation and downtime allow the brain to recover, leading to improved cognitive performance and mental clarity.
   - **Memory Consolidation:** Relaxation and sleep are crucial for memory consolidation. Taking time off helps the brain process and store information more effectively, improving long-term memory.

### 3. **Physical Health**
   - **Cardiovascular Health:** Chronic stress from overworking can increase the risk of heart disease and hypertension. Taking time to relax, particularly through activities like meditation, yoga, or leisurely walks, can lower blood pressure and reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
   - **Immune System Function:** Stress weakens the immune system, making the body more susceptible to illnesses. Relaxation and time away from work can enhance immune function, leading to better overall health.

### 4. **Enhanced Creativity and Productivity**
   - **Incubation Period:** Research shows that taking breaks or stepping away from a problem can lead to better creative solutions. The "incubation period" allows the subconscious mind to process information, leading to innovative ideas when you return to work.
   - **Sustained Focus:** Regular relaxation can prevent mental fatigue and increase sustained attention and focus when you're working, leading to greater productivity.

### 5. **Improved Relationships**
   - **Quality Time:** Taking time off allows for more quality time with family and friends, which is crucial for maintaining strong social connections. These relationships provide emotional support, which is vital for mental health.
   - **Work-Life Balance:** Regular relaxation and time off contribute to a healthier work-life balance, reducing the risk of interpersonal conflicts and promoting a more fulfilling personal life.

### 6. **Better Sleep**
   - **Sleep Quality:** Overworking and stress can lead to sleep disturbances, such as insomnia. Taking time to relax and disconnect from work-related stressors can improve sleep quality, which is essential for overall health and cognitive function.
   - **Sleep-Wake Cycle:** Regular downtime helps maintain a healthy circadian rhythm, ensuring that the body gets adequate rest and recovery.

### 7. **Increased Longevity**
   - **Overall Health:** Numerous studies have linked regular vacations and relaxation with increased lifespan. The combination of reduced stress, better physical health, and improved mental well-being contributes to a longer, healthier life.

### Closing
This is the year I gave up a two-week vacation to help support a delivery project. I don't regret that choice, it was an important job, a great team, and a good bank of experience to build. That said, remembering that we have limits, and setting healthy boundaries is one of the key things I've learned in recent life. It's an honorable thing, and a privilege, to have a career, any career, but we are all of us just human. As Seneca says "Life is long enough" - the trick is in the balance of all things that makes it a full one.
