One of my colleagues back in Texas overheard me cursing at my oatmeal one morning. I’ve always had a less than perfect relationship with its bland, wet and lumpy self. No matter how much raisins, maple syrup, pecans I threw at it … it was still … oatmeal. It’s only saving grace is that it’s incredibly cheap and a really healthy addition to one’s diet.

So I finally thought about it for a while and decided, maybe, it simply needs to grow up a little. After a little morning Yoga, I threw some very grown up elements at it and damn if it didn’t taste _really_ good! Finally, an oatmeal I can enjoy without a coworker thinking I’m crazy to one hate the stuff or two that I’m crazy for talking to a bowl of oatmeal. (The crazy part may actually be true I’m afraid.)

  5. Add garlic and Sriracha to oats.
  6. Move oats to a bowl and top with poached egg.
  7. Have and head out to the office.
