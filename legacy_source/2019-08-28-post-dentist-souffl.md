Back during our Hunter & 2nd Avenue days I used to make soufflé. I think it was actually in this now beat to Hell and back copy of “[The Martha Stewart Cookbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828162729/http://www.amazon.com/Martha-Stewart-Cookbook-Collected-Recipes/dp/0517703351/ref=sr_1_1/187-9973652-9306227?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1407712305&sr=1-1&keywords=the+martha+stewart+cookbook)” circa 1995 where the whole thing started. I remember a lot of wine & dinner parties with the chocolate soufflé as desert and quite a few Thanksgiving Dinners with the corn version.

With my partner waiting until Saturday for an oral surgery I found we’d soon face a new sort of foodie challenge. After he spent the day in and out of consciousness my thoughts turned to … what do we feed him? Mac & Cheese is one of my favorites but I wanted something kind of fresh with a little wow for a mouth that wasn’t feeling so great. When I opened the cheese drawer that’s when it hit me. Soufflé.

I’m all about these great tomato sandwiches with fresh mozzarella since it’s August in the Mid West. So we had a lot of great cheese remnants which served as the replacement for the traditional Gruyère which, sadly, I had none of on hand. Otherwise the recipe is pretty much the same as the [article](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828162729/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Classic-Cheese-Souffle-242119) Epicurious posted. Of course I’m a little rusty since I haven’t tried my whisk hand in quite awhile. It was however really good hearing him say it made his palette feel alive and fresh again. (I think some of that came from the goat cheese and nutmeg).

Ingredients

  * 1/3 of a package of crumbled chèvre cheese
  * 1/3 cup shredded fresh mozzarella cheese
  * 1/8 cup grated Swiss cheese
  * 1 cup whole milk
  * 2 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
  * 3 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour
  * 1/2 teaspoon paprika
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * Pinch of ground nutmeg
  * 4 large egg yolks
  * 5 large egg whites



Process

  1. Position rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 400F.
  2. Butter 6-cup (1 1/2-quart) soufflé dish.
  3. Cut 7 butter parchment paper to support sides of soufflé during cooking.
  4. Warm milk in heavy small saucepan over medium-low heat until steaming.
  5. Melt butter in heavy large saucepan over medium heat.
  6. Add flour and whisk until mixture begins to foam and loses raw taste, about 3 minutes (do not allow mixture to brown).
  7. Remove saucepan from heat; let stand 1 minute.
  8. Pour in warm milk, whisking until smooth.
  9. Return to heat and cook, whisking constantly until very thick, 2 to 3 minutes.
  10. Remove from heat; whisk in paprika, salt, and nutmeg.
  11. Add egg yolks 1 at a time, whisking to blend after each addition.
  12. Scrape soufflé base into large bowl.
  13. Cool to lukewarm. DO AHEAD: Can be made 2 hours ahead.
  14. Cover and let stand at room temperature.
  15. Using electric mixer, beat egg whites in another large bowl until stiff but not dry.
  16. Fold 1/4 of whites into lukewarm or room temperature soufflé base to lighten.
  17. Fold in remaining whites in 2 additions while gradually sprinkling in cheese mix.
  18. Transfer batter to prepared dish.
  19. Place dish in oven and immediately reduce oven temperature to 375F. Bake until soufflé is puffed and golden brown on top and center moves only slightly when dish is shaken gently, about 25 minutes (do not open oven door during first 20 minutes).
  20. Serve immediately.
