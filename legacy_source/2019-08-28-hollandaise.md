There is a restaurant in Oakcliff Texas named [Smoke](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828151010/http://smokerestaurant.com/). Eddie and I would go there pretty frequently often times ordering the BBQ pork with poached egg atop an expertly prepared biscuit drizzled with an amazing hollandaise sauce. It’s definitely part of our Texas past. Having company in this weekend we tried our hand at recreating the experience.

The catch here is while I’m pretty handy with a Béchamel… I’ve never made hollandaise. Eddie made his biscuits again and a delicious BBQ pork shoulder he prepped earlier on Friday. The dish came off very well with hints of lemon from the sauce.

Our guest had made a fantastic pineapple habañero salsa with cilantro which went exceptionally well with the BBQ and Hollandaise flavors.

As usual with first attempts we decided the dish needed some sort of greens in addition to a mix of spicy-rich-smoky notes to fully recapture that Texas flavor.
