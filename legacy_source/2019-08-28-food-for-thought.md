I have this wonderful friend who is nothing less than an angel on earth. She’s been the one who has continually popped in and out of my life like a time traveler keeping tabs on those of us lucky enough to know her. Loss is something that has been a constant companion. Her mother, then her father, her husband and a good friend recently. It’s probably that hard earned knowledge over decades which she uses in conjunction with her seemingly endless power to send love out across the world around her.

Last week she initiated a conversation thread to surround another one of our friends with love and remembrance as her father passed away suddenly and unexpectedly. It was her simple act of kindness that brought me to drive to our hometown and visit my old friend on a Wintry Saturday morning to offer what I could. Just being there.

Saturday came with blizzard like conditions and white out related accidents on the highway. Once I got there I found the wonderful human being I once knew in High School, college and as room mates mourning the loss of her father in the company of her family and many friends.

Our lives took us in different directions. It was Patty who sent out the call to love-action. And it was me who rediscovered a long lost friend in return. Jodi was one of the first people I looked up to for her drive, dedication, work ethic, humor and sheer creativity. She was also one of a close circle of friends (Dave, Ernie, Patty and Jodi) who gave me courage when I needed it while coming out as a gay man.

I was sad that she lost her father. I was overjoyed to see her again in celebration of her father and our friendship.

Beautifully stated, Jeff. I spent athe better part of Saturday thinking about how fortunate I am to have such smart, capable women in my life. Patty and Jodi are the kind of women I would want my daughter to be, if I had one. We should strive to have non funeral gatherings at least twice a year.

Though I do not know Patty well, upon meeting her, I had a sense she was special. Your beautiful tribute confirms what I have instinctly felt about her and am so grateful that she made a family member so deeply happy. Thank you.

Heartfelt! You are a lucky man to have found friends in your youth that you can keep for a lifetime.
