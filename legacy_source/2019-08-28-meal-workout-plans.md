It’s Saturday so that means meal planning and grocery shopping. This week I pulled out my trusty copy of “[The America’s Test Kitchen Complete Vegetarian Cookbook](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828164146/https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Vegetarian-Cookbook-Foolproof-Recipes/dp/1936493969)” and flipped through that while having coffee this morning with a friend visiting from Chicago. We caught up on the doings at our mid year checkpoints. His recent push back to making artwork, some of which spoke to his experience with prostate cancer, various things he’d been doing to his house and then house plants as I am interested in getting one for my bedroom for the air quality and green aspect of them.

Another topic I researched today was the mixing of weight training and cardio. I think it’s time for me to get more comfortable lifting weights on a regular basis because it was something that I used to really enjoy. That said I’m also toying with the idea of trying, for a third time, to train for the Columbus marathon so the right amount of cross training will be something to consider. Anyway, I read this long [post](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828164146/https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/topicoftheweek34.htm) on timing those two activities which was pretty helpful. These days my weight training will either be at home on my bench with dumbbells, maxing out at 40 lbs right now, or at the Audobon Park on one of my runs to do pull-ups, push-ups, possibly handstand practice, outdoors. I guess the main thing for me is that I’m looking forward to seeing my workouts evolve a little bit. Just like my meditation practice, I guess. I’m finding that good things happen when you loosen your grip a little more.

After a bit, I came up with the following list of dishes for the next week’s meal plan. And while my pattern has been breakfast, snack, lunch, snack and then dinner. I think I will try to mix in more protein, including MRP shakes and nuts/seeds/bean/lentils/quinoa/brown rice this week. Keep an eye on the fat intake a little tighter… because I have to maintain heart health. And of course, berries with psyllium husk fiber, spirulina, and Maca.

  * Cucumber, red onion and tomato salad (summer classic)
  * Braised beets with lemon and almonds (page 282)
  * Sesame glazed bok choy with noodles (page 284)
  * Broiled eggplant with basil (page 297)
  * Sautéed mushrooms (page 304)
  * Baked sweet potato “fries” (page 317)
  * Sautéed summer squash (page 319)
  * Pizza dough for any kind of mix we have (page 331)
  * Korean BBQ tempeh wraps (page 360)
  * Various forms of tacos and quesadillas to reuse leftovers and various produce
  * Salads – mostly spinach but with some fruits, nuts and cucumbers or peppers
  * Oats or huevos rancheros tacos, using egg whites and 1 egg yolk, for breakfast



So here’s to tasty meals and sweaty balls next week.
