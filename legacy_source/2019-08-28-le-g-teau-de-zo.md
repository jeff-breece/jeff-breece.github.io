I’ve been trying to work with chocolate a little more than I have in the past. So I have three bricks of El Rey, Callebuet and Valrhona in the pantry. When I read the article “Simple Supper, Paris,” by Adriane Moore in Monocle Issue 62 I decided to try the Le gâteau de Zoé. A flourless chocolate cake. And now I have two bricks of chocolate in the pantry.

Ingredients  
4 organic eggs  
200 g good quality dark chocolate  
120 g slightly salted butter  
1 small cup of espresso  
1 drop orange blossom water  
80g caster sugar  
Single cream (Crème fleurette)  
Butter and line bottom of cake pan

Directions  
1 Break eggs & separate the yolks with the sugar until uniform.  
2 Beat the whites until firm.  
3 Melt butter with the chocolate then slowly add the coffee, egg yolks and egg whites in sequence.  
4 Pour into the baking pan.  
5 Bake at 355 for 15 to 17 minutes.  
6 Serve with the single cream, slightly whipped, sugared with a drop of orange blossom water.
