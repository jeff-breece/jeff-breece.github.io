# Pumpkin Protein Bars

__Posted on[ November 5, 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/https://jeffbreece.com/pumpkin-protein-bars/ "Pumpkin Protein Bars") by [![](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e0ec49ea47c3c9e70f0f0098fd1a4d12?s=32&d=mm&r=g)Jeff Breece](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/https://jeffbreece.com/author/jeff/ "View all posts by Jeff Breece") Posted in [food](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/https://jeffbreece.com/category/food/) — [No Comments ↓](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/https://jeffbreece.com/pumpkin-protein-bars/#respond)

So I bought a copy of “[Eat Green Get Lean](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Green-Get-Lean-Vegetarian-ebook/dp/B00F4DZXU0)” by Michael Matthews in my continuing attempt to add more vegetarian fare into the rotation while trying to lose 15 pounds. His Pumpkin Protein Bar [recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/http://www.muscleforlife.com/recipe-of-the-week-maple-pumpkin-protein-bars/) fit the need.

I was looking for a healthier mid-morning snack to replace the wonderful potato [knish](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knish) from [Katzinger’s at the North Market](https://web.archive.org/web/20190629013655/http://www.northmarket.com/meet-the-market/our-merchants/katzingers-little-deli.aspx). These were a good first attempt. The next time I make them I will probably add some dates into the mix to give it a bit more moisture and chewy flavor. They freeze & reheat well.

In short, a pretty good snack.

Ingredients

  * 1 (15 ounce) can Great Northern beans, drained and rinsed
  * 1/2 cup pumpkin purée
  * 4 tablespoons maple syrup
  * 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
  * 1/4 teaspoon salt
  * 1 cup raisin bran cereal
  * 6 scoops vanilla whey protein powder
  * 1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats
  * 1 cup spelt flour (or substitute of your choice)



Process

  1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
  2. In a food processor or blender add all the ingredients except the oats and flour. Blend until smooth, then pour in dry ingredients and pulse until just combined.
  3. Lightly coat a 9 x 13 inch baking dish in cooking spray and spread the mixture out evenly.
  4. Place in oven and bake for 15 – 18 minutes, or until set. Remove and cut into 10 bars.
