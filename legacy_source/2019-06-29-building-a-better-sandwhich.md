After two weeks worth of brown rice, broccoli and curried chicken I’m making a sandwich for lunch. While there’s a time and a place for white bread and mayo, I’m taking a healthier turn today using pita, Dijon and avocado in conjunction with roasted chicken breasts and some spare veggies.

Next up … oatmeal raisin protein cupcakes and a run before dinner.

Ingredients

  * Pita bread
  * Roasted chicken breast
  * Salt & Pepper
  * Olive oil
  * Avocado
  * Tomato – chopped
  * Spinach – shredded
  * Broccoli
  * Dijon mustard
  * Pickles – chopped



Process

  1. In a bowl, toss chicken breasts with olive oil, salt & pepper.
  2. Mix avocado & mustard together in a bowl.
  3. Bring oven to 350 degrees F and cook on middle rack for 25 minutes turning once (test with cooking thermometer).
  4. Slather mustard & avocado mixture inside a pita cut into two halves.
  5. Add broccoli, chicken, avocado, tomato, pickle and spinach.
  6. Add a little grated cheese if desired.
  7. Enjoy.
