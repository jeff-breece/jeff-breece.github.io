After all that fancy Christmas food I was craving something super basic and reasonably healthy. I had a bottle of [Maumee Bay Total Eclipse](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828163730/http://www.mbaybrew.com/product/total-eclipse-breakfast-stout/) left from a dinner party in November that I was saving for something like this. The following recipe was adapted from the [original](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828163730/http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Beef-and-Dark-Beer-Chili-237096) both on quantities and ingredients reflecting what I had on hand at the time.

Served with cornbread fresh out of the oven made it a perfect pre New Years Eve dinner… and portioned out into lunches for the next two weeks.

Ingredients

  * 1 1/2 tbsp. ground cumin
  * 1 tbsp. ground coriander
  * 1 tbsp. tumeric
  * 1 tbsp. aleppo pepper powder
  * 7 tbsp. chili powder
  * 2 pounds ground chuck
  * 2 tbsp. olive oil
  * 2 large yellow onions, coarsely chopped
  * 2 red bell peppers, seeded, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
  * 1 pounds yellow bell peppers, seeded, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
  * 1 28-ounce cans crushed tomatoes with added puree
  * 1 15-ounce cans kidney beans, drained
  * 1 15-ounce cans great northern beans, drained
  * 1 12-ounce bottle dark beer (such as stout)
  * Sour cream
  * Chopped green onions
  * Coarsely grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese



Preparation

  * Sauté beef in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until no longer pink, breaking up with spoon, about 8 minutes.
  * Drain meat and pot then return pot with meat to stove top.
  * Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat.
  * Add onions and sauté until soft then add bell peppers and continue until they become slightly soft but still firm (roughly 15 minutes for this step).
  * Add mixture to pot with meat.
  * Mix in spices.
  * Add crushed tomatoes, beans, and beer.
  * Bring chili to low boil, stirring occasionally.
  * Reduce heat and simmer 20 minutes, stirring often.
  * Season with salt and pepper.
  * Ladle chili into bowls. Serve with sour cream, green onions, and cheese.
