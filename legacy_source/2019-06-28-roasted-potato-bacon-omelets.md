Many years ago I dated an actor who taught me how to make a decent breakfast. While the romance ended when he ran off to do Summer Stock work, he left me with the thought that all of our relationships teach us something that we need to prepare us for our next great love.

Eddie occasionally reminds me of “those great potato and bacon omelet’s you used to make me when….” And with freshly roasted potatoes in the fridge from last night’s [Crisp Roast Garlic Lemon Chicken & Potatoes](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628225825/https://jeffbreece.com/?p=284), I made breakfast for the both of us on a wonderfully breezy springtime in Central Ohio morning.

Ingredients

  * 5 to 6 eggs
  * ¼ cup heavy cream
  * 1 tbsp. Sriracha sauce
  * 1 cup chopped spinach
  * 3 to 4 big pieces of thick cut bacon in chunks (I had precooked this)
  * Pre roasted potatoes
  * 2 tbsp. unsalted butter
  * Kosher salt
  * Ground pepper
  * ¼ cup grated muenster (Fontina would be a really good substitute)



Process

  1. Combine eggs, heavy cream, Sriracha into a bowl and whisk.
  2. In a small sauté pan melt butter on medium low.
  3. Add previously roasted potatoes and heat for about 8 to 12 minutes flipping gently to avoid breaking.
  4. Sprinkle bacon and heat for 4 to 8 minutes tossing gently.
  5. Reduce heat slightly and place spinach on top of the potato bacon mix to wilt.
  6. In a large sauté pan add olive oil coating sides of pan.
  7. Bring to medium heat and pour in egg mixture.
  8. Crack some pepper onto egg mix and throw in a pinch of salt for flavor.
  9. As the egg mix begins to set, forming a structure around the edges that pulls away from the edge of the pan gentle shake the pan until the omelet base slides freely.
  10. Toss the omelet over to complete cooking of the opposite side.
  11. Fold potato, bacon, spinach & cheese mix onto one half of the omelet.
  12. Fold the un-topped side of the omelet onto the topped side.
  13. Slice in half and serve.
