Ratatouille is one of those quick things an 8 year old child can throw together. As such it’s always satisfying. I had an eggplant sitting on the counter staring at me all week and a ton of fresh tomatoes so I decided tonight was the night. Same thing with the barley and a desire to throw in some grains onto the plate. The lemon and oil blanched green beans are an attempt to slow down on the chocolate snacks. I’m hoping the fresh crunch and lemon flavor will satisfy some of those cravings.

Ratatouille Ingredients

  * 1 yellow onion chopped
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 1 eggplant in 2″ pieces (peel skin if desired)
  * 8 to 10 fresh ripe tomatoes
  * 3 zucchini chopped into 1″ poieces
  * 2 stalks celery cut in 1/’8 inch pieces diagonally
  * 15 stalks of asparagus choped
  * 7 cloves of garlic crushed then diced
  * basil, thyme, oregano, fresh ground pepper
  * 2 tsp. tomato paste
  * 1 tbsp. sriracha
  * 3 cups red wine

  2. Add in celery and garlic (2 minutes).
  3. Pour in wine and add tomato paste, sriracha and spices.
  4. Add in tomatoes, zucchini and eggplant.
  5. Reduce to a low simmer and cook for 20 minutes until vegetables are cooked but still slightly al dente.
