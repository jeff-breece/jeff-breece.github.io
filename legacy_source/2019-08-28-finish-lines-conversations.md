It’s an amazing feeling to cross the finish line of any race. It can sometimes be that desperate push to the end of a grueling experience or like turning the last page in a favorite book.

I finished the Columbus 10k this past Sunday and with the pictures having been published I’m reminded of what a great experience it was to run alongside the 9 minute pacer and talk with him and the folks around us through the race. Sharing stories together while running… that’s the best part of the experience.
