Facebook reminded me that one year ago yesterday I found an article in our local paper about a stroke survivor, [Robert Gast](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628230219/http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2015/05/02/half-marathon.html "Two years after stroke, runner finishes Capital City Half Marathon"), who ran in the Cap City Half Marathon. The same race my cousin and I did together last Saturday.

One year later and here I am feeling grateful to have a life full of family, running, good food, interesting work and the inspiration that folks like Robert gave me without knowing it along the way.
