# Time out

Published by [Jeff Breece](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001033525/https://jeffbreece.com/author/jeff/) on [April 18, 2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20201001033525/https://jeffbreece.com/2020/04/)

After having gotten riled up last night at a friend who is blatantly disregarding quarantine, for reasons I won’t go into, I am finding it hard to continue living the way I used to think was normal. Including social media apps and conversations over SMS. Yeah, they can be tools to foster a sense of connection but, I gotta say, I want to live my own quarantine the way I think is best. For me, that means with less noise and on my own. If I could right now, I’d leave town and go do a long hike over several months by myself. Alone. But I can’t so I plan to hunker down further and weather this storm out the best I can. 

Here’s hoping for better days. But for now, this is my final post for some time to come. Best of luck to all.
