Talking with a couple vegetarians at the office started this whole track earlier this fall. I made this dish, again with things I had on hand and very little energy to execute but enough desire to see it through one weekend. It’s made for some great lunches as I portioned and froze much of it for the weeks ahead.

The following recipe is slightly adapted from the [original](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828170059/http://jenniferskitchen.com/2013/02/kale-carrot-and-chickpea-soup.html).

Ingredients

  * 1 medium yellow onion, diced
  * 7 medium raw carrots, sliced thin or diced small
  * 4 stalks celery, diced
  * 3 tbsp. olive oil
  * 7 cups chopped kale
  * 6 cloves garlic, minced
  * 4 cups vegetable stock
  * 2 tbsp. chopped parsley
  * 1 tsp. basil
  * 1 1/2 tsp. Kosher salt
  * 3 cups cooked chickpeas



Process

  1. In a large soup pot, sauté onion, carrot, and celery in oil over medium (not high) heat until onion begins to turn translucent.
  2. Add greens and sauté until greens are tender. Stir often to prevent vegetables from sticking.
  3. Add garlic and sauté for one additional minute.
  4. Add stock and seasoning and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are tender.
  5. Gently stir in chickpeas and add salt to taste.
  6. Serve hot.
