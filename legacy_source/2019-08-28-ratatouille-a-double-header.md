# Ratatouille: A double header.

Some friends with green thumbs recently shared a wealth of tomatoes and a variety of fresh peppers with me. With a couple eggplants on the counter and a few yellow onions I had it in my head to make ratatouille for the first time in well over a decade. I pulled out my copy of [“The Marathon Chef” by Michel Roux Jr](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828162830/http://www.amazon.com/The-Marathon-Chef-Food-Getting/dp/0297843095/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1410213446&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Marathon+Chef) as I like how simple and French his style is. Of course it makes enough food for a small, but very hungry, family so we had enough leftovers for an interesting twist on vegetarian lasagna (thus the second recipe in this post). Both turned out pretty good.

Note: I altered the Ratatouille recipe based on what I had on hand but it’s essentially based on the original.

# Ratatouille Lasagna

Process

  1. Drain the cooked Ratatouille mixture using a colander and a large bowl to separate the liquid from the mixture and reserve for the cream sauce.
  2. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming.
  3. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until the mixture bubbles and begins to come away from the side of the pan.
  4. Remove from heat.
  5. Gradually add half the heavy cream, whisking constantly with a balloon whisk until smooth.
  6. Gradually add the remaining heavy cream, whisking until smooth and combined.
  7. As the sauce becomes stiff slowly add in the liquid Ratatouille mixture and continue stirring for 10 to 15 minutes.
  8. Place over medium-high heat.
  9. Cook, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, for 5 minutes or until sauce thickens and coats the back of the spoon.
  10. Remove from heat. Stir in parmesan. Season with salt, nutmeg and cayenne pepper.
  11. Preheat oven to 180°C.
  12. Spread one-third of the sauce over the base of a 3L (12-cup) capacity rectangular baking dish.

  14. Top with half the ratatouille.
  15. Continue layering with remaining sauce, lasagna sheets and ratatouille.

  17. Bake for 40 minutes or until golden.
  18. Set aside for 10 minutes to stand.
