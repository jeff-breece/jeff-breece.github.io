After the pies my imagination is running around all over the dinner plate. The following are all things that caught my eye Sunday night and will be making an appearance in my dinner rotations soon.

  * Moussaka by Julia Child from the ubiquitous “Mastering the Art of French Cooking”
  * ‘Golden Vegetable Crust’ for a quiche, and a good use for the Summer squash we picked up, using Moosewoods “The Enchanted Broccoli Forest.”
  * Thai Fried Rice from “Bill’s Open Kitchen” by Bill Granger.
  * Guacamole from “Mexican Everyday” by Rick Bayless.
