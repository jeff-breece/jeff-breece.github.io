Two points during a great conversation with very dear friends at a French restaurant in The Bishops Art’s District this afternoon. “Do you think everyone has the capacity for creativity?” Next an observation related to the more abstract idea of losing our ability to communicate.

I feel both are the same. It’s the risks we take, and our leaps of faith, into the impossible that bring both creativity and conversation to life.

It’s what makes us choose to expend ‘our own powers of adjustment.’ Navigating along new coordinates across the worlds between us. All it takes is personal involvement and a measure of courage.

Looking back on this draft, four months later, made me think of a picture I snapped while in Columbus on a job interview. 10/31/2013. “Personal involvement and a measure of courage” indeed.
