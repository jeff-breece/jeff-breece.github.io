_This post is dedicated to my team at Grant Heart Health Center and the folks who have encouraged and inspired me to run… and of course Eddie. “Go Forth and Have no Fear”_

I’ve been catching up on magazines today. It’s one of my weekend things.

Granted nutrition is on my mind, and all over my social media feed; however this was the week I got some powerful news. All of the lifestyle changes I’ve been adopting in an effort to fight heart disease have begun to show some progress. This alone is proof that lifestyle can have significant effect on health. There is of course no cure. I’m choosing to look at health as a holistic set of variables.Thus providing the framework to take control of the few things we can actually own… and change if we are lucky. My tools include meditation, a focus on being present, time spent unplugged, low fat vegetarian diet, exercise and stress management techniques.

Time for the news. This was the week I was told that my cholesterol medication could be reduced by 50%. My head exploded, in a good way, when I heard that. It’s these moments of validation I have been working toward slowly. And like with running… I did this with the support of my health professionals, friends and family. Of course I have to embrace the possibility of future setbacks. That however falls under the category of the unknown. As such, it’s something I don’t have to acknowledge beyond today’s choices.

To be clear, I don’t believe medicine is bad. Medicine is a powerful tool which should be treated with deep respect. But for the lifesaving power it provides, there is often times a cost. As such I only want to take the minimum amount prescribed by medical professionals based on a thorough analysis of the current situation. My mission in life right now is to work with, not against, my team in order to keep CAD at bay for as long as I can.

I want to run marathons. Maybe a triathlon by the time I hit 49 if I’m lucky. But, as I wrote about in an earlier post, that’s looking too far ahead. That last phrase has become one of my most important life lessons from the past seven months.

So it’s time to get back to magazine reading for a minute. I came across an info-graphic style page from the Nov/Dec issue of [Bicycling](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828144339/http://www.bicycling.com/) which caught my eye. It spoke about maple syrup as a sports drink. Like an energy gel equivalent. Benefits cited include a whole string of phytonutrients, electrolytes, minerals, trace vitamins and sucrose in a water soluble form. While I only use the absolute _minimum_ salt and fat these days, I will probably keep the pinch of salt, on the conservative side, prescribed below for the workouts that last 1 to 2 hours or more.

Mix the following and pour into 2 16 oz PCB free bottles for the running or bike trail.

  * 3 1/2 cups cold filtered water
  * 1/4 cup maple syrup
  * 1/4 cup orange juice (fresh if you can)
  * 2 tablespoons lime juice
  * Pinch of salt

Nice posting-I can remember going on a field trip when I was in elementary school to collect maple syrup.

Thanks Jeff and you inspire all of us every day-
