I had a chance to participate in the Hot Chocolate Run 15k with my cousin today. She’s this bright young thing full of spirit and energy with an amazing measure of wisdom and heart.

The run itself was a wonderful stroll up a street which holds several decades worth of memories for me. From downtown, through the Short North, Victorian Village and OSU. With the exception of Clintonville it was my entire life experience in Columbus while wearing running shoes and tights.

I was glad to participate in this with all those old memories flashing through my mind as my cousin ran on ahead of me making new ones.
