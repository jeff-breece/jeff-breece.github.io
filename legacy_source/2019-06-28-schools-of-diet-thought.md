There’s a lot of confusion about diet’s. There are 1000’s of different types of diets for weight loss, cross fit, running, ageless beauty, health and performance.

I am currently writing a post about my year and a half long journey toward achieving a total cholesterol of 93 with a great HDL to LDL ratio in the process. The main thing I learned was the distinction between diet and lifestyle. Like my dad said, “it’s not what you do every now and then, it’s what you do everyday.”
