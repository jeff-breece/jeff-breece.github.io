# Green Soup with a Southern Flair

I’ve been going to the [Clintonville Farmers Market](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628120512/http://www.clintonvillefarmersmarket.org/) for about a month now. Every week seeing something new as Spring eases into the beginnings of Summer in Ohio. Starting of course with a bumper crop of asparagus now giving way to turnips, beets, greens of all sorts, mushrooms, strawberries and such. With a gift of home grown Swiss Chard from a colleague in the fridge in mind I picked up turnips, yellow beets and kale this morning with a friend who made the trek on a cool Saturday morning.

I cropped the tops off the beets and the turnips, washed and stemmed those with half the fresh kale and all the chard then proceeded to make a recipe titled “Eat Your Greens” from the book [“Better than Vegan” by Del Sroufe](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628120512/http://www.amazon.com/Better-Than-Vegan-Favorite-Plant-Based/dp/1939529425). Mid way through of course I made some course changes based on what I had on hand and seeming shifts in the wind direction. What I ended up with was a green soup that reminded me of the Julia Child [Pottage au Florentine](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628120512/https://jeffbreece.com/?p=180) with the rice to thicken it and the egg yolk at the end. The flavor is all Southern greens though and pretty amazing. I’m picturing it with ricotta toasts and fresh garden tomatoes already.

If you are a fan of the hearty flavors found within a pot of Southern style greens and enjoy a smooth textured French style soup without the artery clogging fats this is your dish.
