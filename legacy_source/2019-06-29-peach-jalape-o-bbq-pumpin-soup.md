My cousins husband recently gave us some of the wonderfully crafted sauces and vinaigrettes he’s always posting on FaceBook. Having stocked the freezer with freshly baked pumpkin through October in addition to making fresh vegetable stock on a regular basis… I had a surplus of some good basics. Eying the jalapeño peach BBQ sauce Rusty gave us, I decided to perform a bit of pumpkin soup alchemy when a little comfort was needed this week. The end result was a beautifully warm, savory, spicy (with just a hint of sweet) bowl of awesome.

It’s good to come from a family of great people and good cooks.

Ingredients

  * 2 cups frozen baked pumpkin (if using canned go organic and not sweetened for pie).
  * 4 cups fresh vegetable stock
  * 1/4 cup jalapeño peach BBQ sauce
  * 1 tsp. cinnamon
  * 1 tsp. nutmeg
  * 1 tbsp. Kosher salt
  * 1 tsp. turmeric
  * 1 cup half and half
  * 1 large yellow onion (chopped)
  * 3 tbsp. olive oil



Process

  1. Pour pureed pumpkin into a saucepan and add the vegetable stock, BBQ sauce and spices.
  2. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes.
  3. Reduce heat to simmer.
  4. Caramelize onion in olive oil then add to soup base.
  5. Stir in half and half slowly.
  6. Puree in batches in high powered blender or food processor.



Enjoy with a plain old grilled cheese sandwich for the ultimate in comfort on a cold night.
