There’s a point in most people’s childhood where, looking back, we can almost hear our mothers talking about sneaking vegetables into our diets. Mine was no exception. I remember mom coming up with these great late summer early fall treats for us. The mountain of fresh zucchini in the kitchen seemingly escaping notice.

Eddie and I had a handful of zucchinis in the fridge, it was Sunday morning and I wanted something good for later in the day. I pulled out a really beat up copy of “The Martha Stewart Cookbook,” circa 1995. In it was a great recipe but the size of it was meant for a catering job. Over coffee I flipped through the “Joy of Cooking,” nothing. It was an Australian cookbook that caught my eye next, “Bills Food” which came with an insert for “Bills Coconut Bread” that hit the mark. I adjusted his recipe by removing the coconut, adding the pecans and zucchini and subbing the castor sugar for white (I know its poison but we all have to die from something).

In the end it came out great, crisp crust, great moistness and an agreeably fresh nutty flavor.

Ingredients

  * 2 eggs
  * 1 ¼ cups milk
  * 1 tsp vanilla
  * 2 ½ cups flour
  * 2 tsp baking powder
  * ½ tsp salt
  * 2 tsp cinnamon
  * 1 cup sugar
  * 2 cups grated zucchini
  * 1 cup chopped pecans
  * 1/3 cup melted butter



Process

  1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
  2. Prepare two bread pans by cutting a piece of parchment each for the bottoms; butter the sides and bottoms.
  3. Whisk together the eggs, milk and vanilla until it’s frothy but not stiff.
  4. Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.
  5. Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the egg mixture stirring with a spatula until just combined.
  6. Fold in the zucchini and pecans.
  7. Add butter and stir until smooth but don’t over blend.
  8. Pour into prepared pans in middle of oven and bake for 1 hour.
  9. Cool in pans for 15 minutes then cool on racks.
