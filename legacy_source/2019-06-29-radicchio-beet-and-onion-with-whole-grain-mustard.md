My adventure with beets started in Texas. That’s where I began exploring greens, beets and goat cheese together. This dish boasts a _lot_ of powerful flavors, and health benefits, while at the same time providing these subtle hints of earth from the beets, sweetness from the yams and a great nutty flavor from the walnuts that contrast well with the onions and whole grain Dijon.

Great for a picnic of fresh whole grain bread, hummus and a glass of Riesling.

Ingredients

  * Sherry vinegar – about 1 tbsp
  * Red wine vinegar – about 2 tbsp
  * Extra virgin olive oil – about 3 tbsp.
  * Whole grain Dijon mustard – about 2 tbsp.
  * Walnuts, about a half cup chopped
  * Cilantro one handful roughly chopped
  * Sweet potato roasted, sliced & quartered
  * Beets roasted, sliced & quartered
  * Radicchio roughly chopped
  * Red & white onion sliced and roughly chopped



Process

  1. Mix all ingredients in a bowl.
  2. Chill for 30 minutes or overnight.
  3. Serve or portion out and freeze for lunches.
