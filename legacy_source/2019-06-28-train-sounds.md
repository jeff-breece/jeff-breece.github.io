I love ambient street sounds. Listening to St Patrick’s Day in downtown Columbus yesterday reminded me of Dallas. Maybe it was the Church Bells and police sirens. Regardless, it’s what led me on a hunt for a short video I captured of a train I enjoyed frequently in Dallas from Akard Station. I may dig out my digital recorder and try to capture more of these moments. Every City has a flavor.
