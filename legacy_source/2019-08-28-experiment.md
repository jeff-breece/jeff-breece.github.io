I read [“Don’t sleep with your smartphone nearby,”](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828150839/http://www.cnn.com/2011/10/30/opinion/greene-smart-phone-addiction/index.html) by Bob Greene on CNN a couple weeks ago. While I’m not an app guy, I think I’m aware of the phone (the gateway to email and Twitter) on my nightstand more than I’d like to be. So in a movement toward change, I bought my first wrist watch since High School with an alarm. From here on out the phone sleeps in the home office.
