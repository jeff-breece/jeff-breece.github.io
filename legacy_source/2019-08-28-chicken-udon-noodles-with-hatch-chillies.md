A friend of mine recently reminded me of the simple pleasure of Chicken & Noodles. For most of us it’s wrapped up with memories of being comforted while sick with a steaming bowl of protein and vitamins. This was the first time I had the butcher chop up the bird for me which was a time saver. The recipe was adapted from one I found online and it yields a lot so be prepared to freeze.

Ingredients 

1 2 to 3 lbs chicken fryer, cut up   
4 carrots chopped   
2 hatch chilies chopped (seeds removed)   
4 celery stalks chopped   
1 large yellow onion chopped   
1 to 2 tsp Kosher salt   
1 tsp ground black pepper   
1 bunch of thyme tied with twine   
1 tbsp turmeric   
1 package of Udon noodles (cooked and cooled)   
3 tbsp flour   
1/4 cup heavy cream   
2 tsp chopped parsley 

Process 

Place chicken in a large casserole pot, cover with water then bring to a boil.   
Reduce heat to low and simmer for 45 minutes.   
Set chicken aside to cool briefly then shred the meat with two forks reserving bones to the side.   
Place bones back in the pot and boil for 20 minutes.   
Remove bones from pot and discard.   
Add the shredded chicken, carrots, celery, chillies, and onion to the pot.   
Season with salt and pepper, turmeric and thyme.   
Bring the mix to a gentle boil then reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes.   
Add noodles to pot.   
Mix flour with 1/2 cup of water until smooth then add heavy cream pour into pot.   
Simmer until mix looks golden and the noodles are swimming happily.
