I’m working on a piece about distractions after nearly being hit by a guy in a car on a cellphone earlier this week.

As an introduction of sorts, I’ve been taking advantage of some nice Ohio November weather to take a walk around the park for about a month or so. Midway through I’m making myself sit down for 15 minutes. Clear my head and just listen to my breathing. It’s not really meditation. But I’m finding that it puts me in this calm space for the rest of the day.
