Our June copy of “Southern Living” came when blueberries still cost a small fortune. With The Fourth of July behind us I came across a great bounty of berries on sale at a price that didn’t break the bank. I used the [vodka pie crust](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828161042/https://jeffbreece.com/?p=140) recipe with butter and butter in place of the vegetable shortening.

Inevitably mom and I were texting one another with the pie conversation. I was really flattered to hear she made one as well.

Ingredients

  * 7 cups fresh blueberries
  * 1/4 cup cornstarch
  * 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
  * 1/2 cup sugar
  * 1/3 cup honey
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  * 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
  * 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  * 1/8 teaspoon finely ground black pepper
  * 2 tablespoons butter, cut into 1/4-inch cubes
  * 1 large egg



Process

  1. Prepare Filling: Place 1 cup blueberries in a large bowl; crush blueberries with a wooden spoon. Stir cornstarch and vinegar into crushed berries until cornstarch dissolves. Stir sugar, next 5 ingredients, and remaining 6 cups blueberries into crushed berry mixture.
  2. Unwrap 1 dough disk, and place on a lightly floured surface. Sprinkle with flour. Roll dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Fit dough into a greased (with butter) 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. Repeat rolling procedure with remaining dough disk; cut dough into 12 to 14 (1/2-inch-wide) strips. (You will have dough left over.)
  3. Pour blueberry mixture into pie crust, and dot with butter cubes. Arrange pie crust strips in a lattice design over filling. Trim excess dough.
  4. Re-roll remaining dough, and cut into 6 (9- x 1/2-inch) strips. Twist together 2 strips at a time. Whisk together egg and 1 Tbsp. water. Brush a small amount of egg mixture around edge of pie. Arrange twisted strips around edge of pie, pressing lightly to adhere. Brush entire pie with remaining egg mixture. Freeze 20 minutes or until dough is firm.
  5. Preheat oven to 425°. Bake pie on an aluminium foil-lined baking sheet 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375°, and bake 20 more minutes. Cover pie with aluminium foil to prevent excessive browning, and bake 25 to 30 more minutes (65 to 70 minutes total) or until crust is golden and filling bubbles in center. Remove from baking sheet to a wire rack; cool 12 hours before serving.
