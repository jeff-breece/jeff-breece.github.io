“Syzygy” is a word I came across while thinking about this post over the past three months. Webster’s defines it as “the nearly straight-line configuration of three celestial bodies (as the sun, moon, and earth during a solar or lunar eclipse) in a gravitational system.” Very few things in life line up as planned. The rarity of this situation is what this post is about.

It’s been three months since I left the Dallas skyline and our vertical downtown high-rise neighborhood. A career and industry.

It was November 2013. The summer heat had finally submitted to cooler foggy Texas Autumn weather. That was when the planets lined up during a once in a life time moment. The syzygy that brought us home to our family.

We all find it in different places along the paths of our lives. Parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters, friends … partners. Ambient connections weaving our experiences and conversations into the fabric of life. My nieces and nephews have become young women and men. Our proud parents celebrating all of our successes, challenges, defeats and triumphs. It’s the art of being human. Alive.

My partner, a euphemism I hope to soon replace with the word husband, Eddie and I spent the day with his sister and his parents today. And just like we always have over 20+ years… talked all day, shared stories, laughed, laughed some more and had dinner together.

Family.
