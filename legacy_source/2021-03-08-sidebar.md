# Spooky Hiking

Published by [Jeff Breece](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308034535/https://jeffbreece.com/author/jeff/) on [October 21, 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308034535/https://jeffbreece.com/2019/10/)

This is a [pretty entertaining article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308034535/https://www.outsideonline.com/2403621/most-haunted-campgrounds-us) on the most haunted campgrounds in the States on Outdoors magazine’s site. Note the cool mention of albino trees. I never knew that was a thing! 

Anyway, as I am getting ready for a venture down to Zaleski State Forest the weekend of November 1st and 2nd, after my navigation class the previous weekend, for a post-Halloween hike of the South loop I may swing by the [Moonville Tunnel](https://web.archive.org/web/20210308034535/https://www.moonvilletunnel.net/) and see if I can catch a glimpse of the ghost. Well, since it’s the Day of the Dead that weekend, maybe I should leave him a small bottle of whiskey as rumor has it he died, slightly pickled, while trying to avert two trains from crashing. Unsucessfully. And, well, ended up a bloody mess.

Here’s to one of the most ridiculous, but fun Holidays I suppose.

Boo!
