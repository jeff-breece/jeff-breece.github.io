My mom used to make a “brunch casserole” at Christmas time that was out of this world good. It was one of those egg custards with sausage over white bread topped with American cheese deals. I came across the recipe below while looking for one of my first Dallas Thanksgiving morning breakfasts. I had all the ingredients. The minute it came out of the oven still sizzling and bubbling I was immediately taken back to Marion, Ohio. It was wonderful and comforting.

It’s a great recipe. Easy to make and yields enough for a couple days breakfasts.
