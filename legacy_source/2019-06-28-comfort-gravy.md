It’s autumn in the Midwest. While I grew up here, and lived the better part of my adult life in Columbus, I spent a good chunk of time in Texas, Cincinnati and Kentucky. There’s truth that seasons change everywhere. Fall being one of the most dramatic of the four. In Texas it was when the temperatures returned to 90 degrees and then finally gave way to the 40’s come November. Yesterday our temperatures dropped into the 40’s and the blankets came off various shelves where they were stored. I’m looking forward to the process of the leaves turning all sorts of brilliant colors. You don’t see a lot of that in Texas but you do get these amazing purple fog heavy days and nights when a cold front plays with moisture in the air turning everything surreal.

Eddie and I had roasted a turkey breast toward the later part of the past week. Given that it was our first chilly day, spooky movies & naps were the only things that sounded good so we made mashed potatoes, roast turkey and gravy for dinner. The following was adapted from an [Ina Garten ](https://web.archive.org/web/20190628120542/http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/homemade-gravy-recipe.html) recipe. I wanted something smooth, thick, semi saucy with just a little kick and a bit of Umami (hence the cognac). I’m planning on using some of it this week for the poached eggs over English muffin breakfasts I’ve been making.

It makes about enough for a party of 8.

Ingredients

  * 1 stick unsalted butter
  * ¼ cup flour
  * 1 tbsp. Kosher salt
  * 1 tbsp. cracked black pepper
  * 2 cups fresh chicken stock (or beef if going for a darker style)
  * 2 tbsp. milk
  * 1 tbsp. Sriracha
  * 1 tbsp. cognac



Process

  1. Melt the butter in a sauce pan over medium low heat
  2. Whisk in the flour until thick
  3. Add the salt and pepper
  4. Add in the milk and Sriracha.
  5. Whisk in the cognac, to give it a little extra something.
  6. Pour the stock in slowly whisking until smooth then adding more until finished.
  7. You may add a little more heat on the burner to the tune of a tick to help the gravy form a perfect consistency
