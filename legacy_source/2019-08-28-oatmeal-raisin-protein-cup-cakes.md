I have two weak spots during a given work day diet wise. The fantastic coffee shop, [Cafe Brioso](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828160942/http://www.cafebrioso.com/), on the morning walk into the office with it’s delicious jalapeño scones and, of course, dinner. In an effort to take on one challenge at a time, I have been focusing on the scone. I tried the maple pumpkin protein bars from [Michael Matthews book “Eat Green Get Lean.”](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828160942/http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Green-Get-Lean-Vegetarian/dp/1938895193) These were decent but not the fluffy pumpkin bar with cream cheese frosting mom made when we were kids.

While casually surfing the net this morning I came across a [recipe](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828160942/http://fitfoodiefinds.com/2014/12/pomegranate-oatmeal-snack-cups/) for pomegranate oatmeal snack cups. Using what I had on hand and crossing it back through Mr Matthew’s recipe for the spelt flour and whey powder I came up with the following outcome.

I’m still looking for more of a fluffy cupcake structure but these turned out pretty good. Should be easy to pack in the morning and a reminder to not buy the delicious scone. At least not every morning.

Ingredients

  * 1 small banana
  * 2 large eggs
  * 1/3 cup tart cherry juice
