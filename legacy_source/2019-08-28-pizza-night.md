While Columbus Ohio is no New York or Chicago it does have a fair number of great pizza shops. [Rotolo’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828144707/http://www.rotolospizza.com/), [Panzera’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828144707/http://panzeras.com/), [Dante’s](https://web.archive.org/web/20190828144707/http://dantespizzainc.com/) to name three of my favorites with a solid nod at some High Street shops in the OSU area.

Having moved to Dallas, a more geographically dispersed City, it’s been hard to find good pizza easily. So I’m making my own; starting with the crust, then making a sauce and finishing it off with classic pepperoni and a mix of three cheeses.

Crust

Ingredients  
½ cup of olive oil  
¾ cup plus 2 tbsp of warm milk  
2 tsp sugar  
2 1/3 cups all purpose flour  
2 ¼ tbsp yeast  
½ tsp salt

Process  
Boil some water and fill a medium sized bowl then set aside to warm a space like the inside of a microwave.  
Lightly oil another medium bowl with a brush and olive oil.  
Fill two 9” round cake pans with 2 tbsp each of olive oil.  
Whisk milk, sugar, & 2 tbsp olive oil with yeast.  
Add flour and salt to the bowl of a mixer with a bread hook on low and slowly pour in yeast mix.  
Knead for 5 minutes or so.  
Add a little extra olive oil and a dash of salt at the end for some texture.  
Remove dough from mixer and place into prepared bowl and set in the warm space, microwave with hot water in my case, for 30 minutes to rise until doubled in size.  
Transfer dough to floured board and separate into two balls.  
Use a rolling pin to flatten each ball into a 9” disk then place both into the cake pans; pressing the edges to conform to the sides.  
Place back in warm space for another 20 minutes to continue rising.

Sauce

Ingredients  
1 fresh tomato chopped  
1 can of diced fire roasted tomatoes  
1 tbsp tomato paste  
4 tbsp olive oil  
4 cloves garlic crushed then diced  
2 onions diced  
8 to 12 medium sized white mushrooms (cleaned, trimmed & chopped)  
Salt & pepper  
Oregano & basil chopped  
2 tbsp Red wine

Process  
Sautee onions & mushrooms in olive oil until mushrooms become aromatic & onions slightly soft (5 to 7 minutes).  
Add chopped fresh tomato & garlic (2 to 3 minutes).  
Add canned tomatoes, wine, salt, pepper, herbs and simmer on medium low until wine and some of the liquid reduces (15 minutes or so).

Make the Pizza

Heat oven to 400 degrees.  
Ladle sauce onto pizza dough leaving about ½” around the edges for the crust formation.  
Sprinkle about a 1 ½ cups shredded fresh mozzarella, parmesan & provolone mixed onto each pizza.  
Add peperoni and bake on the middle rack for 20 minutes.
