Super Bowl Sunday dinner option … butternut squash soup with toasted bread and a salad.

Squash soup is another one of those transportive dishes that reminds me of camping in Southern Ohio with friends a few years ago for Halloween. Open fires, a bunch of friends making a coopoerative set of dinners at night and canoing during the day. Good food for good times.

Butternut squash soup (recipe is a mash up of a couple sources with a twist of ground chilies).

1 yellow onion  
more than half a stick of butter  
lots of chopped garlic cloves  
2 cubed butternut squash  
4 TO 5 cups fresh chicken stock  
salt  
pepper  
sage  
ground chilies  
1/4 cup heavy cream  
1/3 cup coarsely chopped Parmesan cheese

Sautee onions and garlic in butter  
Add stock and squash  
Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes  
When squash is tender purée in batches ala Cuisinart  
Add back to pot and stir in heavy cream  
Add Parmesan cheese  
Serve
