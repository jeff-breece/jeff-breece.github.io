Summary: So, about that college education and the career stuff. This is my honest take, from experience, on the benefits of an education that, now, costs an arm and a leg, vs just going the traditional tradesperson route, and why we spend so much time putting one or the other on opposite sides of a scale.

# Opening
I consider myself a tradesman. By definition, somone who typically engages in manual or practical work that requires specific skills, often learned through apprenticeships or hands-on experience. Examples include electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and mechanics. The work is usually task-oriented, focusing on the production, repair, or maintenance of physical structures or systems. Only, my work happens to invole information systems. While I started college after High School to end up in Natural Resources sciences and ultimately forestry, I put a pin in that at year five and pursued a life. This took me through wine sales and then IT work by the indirect path of a stock trade that left the company without a data and analytics person. I had an apptitude and taught myself Unix, then SQL, and then a reporting tool. All of this snowballed into web development and ultimately the tech stack I have grown wide in, .Net and M365.

Yes, I did go back to college in 2006 and finished in 2008, I did it as a Personalized Study Program through OSU. Basically build a bear for college degrees. Mine gave me the chance to use half of my credit work from earlier in life, and then carve a path that sat across three discliplines I thought, at the time, would be a good combination: Java programming, conservation cciences and Digital Media. I wanted something that would thread the needle so to speak and give me some footing toward how to tell stories better. Coding, for me, is just writing. The Digital Media studies gave me enough of a handle on audio, video and photo editing that it helped me to modernize how I produced content for the digital era aven before all of this 2020's era stuff showed up... we were doing You Tube sytle story telling before it became monetizable back then.

Yet, like I alluded to earlier, my career has never actually required a degree. THis is true for so many folks who bear the burden of student loans. You don't have to take that on in my opinion. They can be helpful, the study of critical thinking and resoning. Having a broad point of view rooted in not just STEM tracks but actual Liberal Arts, I would argue, has tremendous value.

What bothers me is the value of one track over the other. And the barriers of entry if you don't have a piece of paper. We tend to break these into two odd categories: tradesmen and professionals. I see both as the same. The following is why.

### 1. **Nature of Work:**
   - **Tradesman:** As seen in my opening, this is usually considered "manual labor." Folks, I have a secret to tell you, all work is manual labor. End of story.
   - **Profession (Medicine/Education):** Professions like medicine or education involve intellectual or cognitive work that is often more abstract and complex. These fields require a deep understanding of theory, analysis, and judgment. Professionals like doctors or teachers often deal with decision-making, diagnosis, and long-term planning in their work.

### 2. **Education and Training:**
   - **Tradesman:** The training for trades typically involves vocational education or apprenticeships, which combine on-the-job training with classroom instruction. The focus is on mastering practical skills and knowledge relevant to the trade.
   - **Profession (Medicine/Education):** Professions like medicine or education require a more extended period of formal education, usually at a college or university. This includes earning degrees, such as a bachelor's, master's, or doctorate, followed by specialized training (e.g., medical residency for doctors). This training emphasizes both theoretical knowledge and the application of that knowledge in professional practice.

### 3. **Licensing and Regulation:**
   - **Tradesman:** Many trades require certification or licensing, which is often governed by trade associations or local regulatory bodies. The focus is on ensuring competency in the specific skills of the trade.
   - **Profession (Medicine/Education):** Professions like medicine or education are usually highly regulated, with professional bodies overseeing licensing, certification, and continuing education. This regulation ensures adherence to ethical standards, legal requirements, and ongoing professional development.

### 4. **Societal Recognition:**
   - **Tradesman:** Trades are often seen as essential and highly skilled, but they may not always receive the same level of societal prestige or recognition as certain professions. However, skilled tradespeople are critical to the functioning of society and are often in high demand.
   - **Profession (Medicine/Education):** Professions like medicine or education typically carry a higher level of societal prestige and are often associated with higher social status. This is partly due to the extensive education required and the critical role these professions play in society's well-being and development.

### 5. **Autonomy and Responsibility:**
   - **Tradesman:** While tradespeople often work independently or run their own businesses, their work is typically more prescribed by specific tasks or projects. Their responsibility is usually focused on the quality and safety of the work they perform.
   - **Profession (Medicine/Education):** Professionals in fields like medicine or education often have significant autonomy in their work, involving complex decision-making, ethical considerations, and a high level of responsibility for the outcomes of their work. For example, doctors make critical decisions regarding patient care, and educators shape the intellectual and social development of students.

In summary, while both trades and professions are crucial to society, they differ in their work nature, required education, regulation, societal perception, and levels of responsibility and autonomy.
